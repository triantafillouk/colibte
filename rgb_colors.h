/*
# The colors in this color dictionary are from the following sources, in
# order.  Some color names may be are defined multiple times, and sometimes
# with different colors.  Many colors have multiple names.
# - Netpbm originals
# - Crayola crayons, as determined by John Thomas at Tektronix
# - Hollasch at Microsoft Research
# - HTML4.0
# - Some HTML extension that Internet Explorer understands
# - XFree86 rgb.txt ca.2001, derived from MIT X11

# More details on the sources are above each group.

# The preferred form of names is The X Window System standard, all one
# word with the initial letter of each word capitalized.  But programs that
# look up in this dictionary should convert the target color name and each
# name in this dictionary to all lower case and remove spaces before
# comparing.
#
# Colors from Crayola crayons, as determined by
# John Thomas at Tektronix
# (taken from http://www.swiss.ai.mit.edu/~jaffer/Color/thomas.txt on
#202.9.3, with all the grayN removed).
# Some colors have changed their values trying to unify the definitions.
