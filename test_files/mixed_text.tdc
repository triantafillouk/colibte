# This is a text with code segments inside

We must be able to correctly skip the document and parse the script parts
The script starts and ends with 3 single back quotes at the start of the line
For the moment the code parts are not correctly highlighted.

```
cls
a=1.1
a!=1	:   1.0
;b=1	# This is else a comment, separator here is transparent
! g=a+b: 2.100000
```

This line is not parsed, but part of the following line is.

# ` a=3.2 `
# the second code segment in this example is below

```
d=a+2*b: 5.200000
# this is a comment line in code
print(d)
```

And this is also not considered as part of the code.
